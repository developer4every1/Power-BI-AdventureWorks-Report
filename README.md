To built AdventureWorks Power BI report followed the key stages of the business intelligence workflow (data prep, data modeling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization & dashboard design) and simulated real-world tasks:


STAGE 1: Connecting & Shaping Data

In this stage focused on building automated workflows to extract, clean, transform, and load our project data using Power Query, and explore common data connectors, storage modes, profiling tools, table transformations, and more:

Data connectors
Storage & import modes
Query editing tools
Table transformations
Connecting to a database
Extracting data from the web
QA & Profiling tools
Text, numerical, date & time tools
Rolling calendars
Index & conditional columns
Grouping & aggregating
Pivoting & unpivoting
Merging & appending queries
Data source parameters
Importing Excel models


STAGE 2: Creating a Relational Data Model

In stage 2 reviewed data modeling best practices and build AdventureWorks data model from the ground up:
Database normalization
Fact & dimension tables
Primary & foreign keys
Star & snowflake schemas
Active & inactive relationships
Relationship cardinality
Filter context & flow
Bi-directional filters
Model layouts
Data formats & categories
Hierarchies


STAGE 3: Adding Calculated Fields with DAX

In stage 3 applied powerful tools like filter functions, iterators, and time intelligence patterns:
DAX and M
Calculated columns & measures
Implicit, explicit & quick measures
Measure calculation steps
DAX syntax & operators
Math & stats functions
Conditional & logical functions
The SWITCH function
Text functions
Date & time functions
The RELATED function
CALCULATE, FILTER & ALL
Iterator (X) functions
Time intelligence patterns



STAGE 4: Visualizing Data with Reports

Stage 4 is about bringing our data to LIFE with reports and dashboards. Building and formatting basic charts, and add interactivity with bookmarks, slicer panels, parameters, tooltips, report navigation, and more:
Data viz best practices
Dashboard design framework
Cards & KPIs
Line charts, trend lines & forecasts
On-object formatting
Table & matrix visuals
Conditional formatting
Top N filtering
Map visuals
Drill up, drill down & drillthrough
Report slicers & interactions
Bookmarks & page navigation
Numeric & fields parameters
Custom tooltips
Importing custom visuals
Managing & viewing roles (RLS)
Mobile layouts
Publishing to Power BI Service


Also introduced brand new features as they are released, powerful artificial Intelligence tools like decomposition trees, key influencers, smart narratives and natural language Q&A, and performance optimization techniques.
